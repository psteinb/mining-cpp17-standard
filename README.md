# Intro

This repo collects my attempts to textmine the C++17 ISO standard. My data source are the .tex files that the ISO standard is created from. To obtain them, I did:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:cplusplus/draft.git
$ cd draft
$ git checkout c++17
```

# Why?

I am a C++ developer by evolution. I like C++. At the same time, I am working in academia. In this field, reproducibility has/will become a prerequisite for publication (and therefor professional survival). Here, I have experienced C++ struggle when trying to publish portable simulations that provide reproducible results across operating systems. I found the cause for this rooted in the C++ standard itself. 

I believe, if C++ wants to strive to be a goto language in the coming centuries, these issues with respect to reproducibility and portability need to be addressed because other languages have solved them already.
